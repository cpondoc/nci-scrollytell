        <br />
        <p class="preface-content">This project serves to be a recap of my experience from a much more personal and intimate point of view. Rather than focusing solely on science, I talk about growth, finding the right work-life balance, and allowing time for introspection. Links to videos, posters, and the publication from my internship are available at the end of the document.</p>
        <p class="preface-content">While many others may see this experience as worthwhile experiences for a resume or a pathway for opening up more opportunity, the experience came at a part in my life where times were hectic, unprecedented, and contemplative. I hope the same can be said for future Werner H. Kirsten Student Interns.</p>

                <div id="animation"><h2 id="story-title">Getting Acquainted üòå </h2></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p class="story-content">I started my internship just like any other student: with high hopes and grandiose ambitions. I was coming off what is notoriously considered the most stressful school year in high school, so I was more than ready to tackle a newfound challenge.</p>
                <p class="story-content">At first, the experience was exhilarating. I was thrust into different seminars and labs, had the opportunity to work alongside fellow interns at the ‚ÄúTake Your Child to Work Day‚Äù event, and was getting accustomed to this thing called ‚Äúwork-life balance.‚Äù Furthermore, I was told that I was going to be performing research on machine learning, a subject that has become somewhat of a buzzword in the technology community. I was instantly hooked.</p>

                <div id="animation2"><h2 id="story-title">Initial Pitfalls üòµ </h2></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p class="story-content">Over time, things still went great; however, there were some hard bumps along the road. For starters, my work-life balance started to suffer a bit. As I delved deeper and deeper into my work, the difficulty of the work started to exact a mental toll, resulting in me going home and napping at every instance I got. Likewise, I started to get into the habit of ‚Äúflaking,‚Äù or making commitments and never truly sticking to them since I was too tired from my job. Assuredly, this was not something that was the fault of my job or mentor, but just my shortcomings.</p>
                <p class="story-content">The social implications aside, machine learning turned out to be a much harder subject to wrap my head around, despite the plethora of open-source materials that could be found on the web. I was so used to classes where I could simply brush off the content until the last day or have old-fashioned notes from my professor, but at my internship, I had to tackle a complex book and weed through mounds and mounds of documentation.</p>
                <p class="story-content">Finally, while there was another intern at my lab, I wasn‚Äôt too open to the idea of collaboration. For the first part of the internship, we focused primarily on different tasks; nevertheless, whether it be during lunch or normal brakes, I would rarely talk to him, making our relationship feel more like acquaintances rather than co-workers.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p class="story-content">The result of all this: a little project that I finished up half-way into my summer internship that, although was aesthetically pleasant, didn‚Äôt show much depth and comprehension into the subject matter. While I sure thought the poster looked neat, looking back at the content and writing can be a painful experience; in fact, I now understand some of the confused glances I was given shortly after reading my poster. Regardless, the experiences and lessons were important to take in, especially as I embarked on a new project.</p>

                <div id="animation4"><h2 id="story-title">Finding Footing ‚úäüèº </h2></div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p class="story-content">As the second half of my summer internship commenced, my mentor presented me with a new project: one that would be extremely more intensive and more guided. After talking about the intricacies of the project, I was instantly hooked, alongside my co-intern. Subsequently following numerous logistics, we began to work.</p>
                <p class="story-content">With half of my summer internship finally under my belt, I developed a better grasp of understanding how I could learn better. One of those ways was through more direct mentorship and interaction with other peers performing similar work. Due to existing connections, my mentor linked my co-intern and me together with interns at Hood College and the Berkeley National Lab, allowing us to engage in weekly meetings about the work we were doing, milestones we had achieved, and plans for the future. Assuredly, many people find meetings to be oftentimes tedious or unnecessary, but I found them as a way to express the thoughts in my head out loud and get some validation, not about the correctness of my work, but that the journey was tough for everyone who was just learning.</p>
                <p class="story-content">Also, as the project was group-based in nature, I started talking a lot more with my other co-intern: no longer just fleeting waves and goodbyes, but more talk about our respective school lives, personal interests, and more. Aside from simply being a great guy, my co-intern‚Äôs anecdotes about his previous internship experience were even more rewarding. As a returning intern in the same lab from previous years, he talked a lot about how he, too, struggled to find his footing with such a technical subject. Even so, he even remarked that I seemed to be grasping the subject matter much faster than he did, which gave me a bit of reassurance.</p>
                <p class="story-content">Finally, I was starting to better manage my time outside of my work, allowing me to spend the day focusing on just my work and the rest of the time on hobbies, social events, and other events that kept me sane. Primarily, I got help from my parents, who encouraged me to enjoy the time outside of Fort Detrick even during times when I felt too tired to traverse anywhere. Even though I had so much I had to learn, the prospect of ‚Äúwork-life balance‚Äù wasn‚Äôt merely some tedious task ‚Äî it was necessary to ensuring the my experience wouldn‚Äôt deteriorate the rest of my wellbeing.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-7">
                <p class="story-content">With July turning into August, we made great strides in our research project. My co-intern and I were often collaborating, shared helpful results and tips to get better statistical results, and killed our end of the summer presentations in front of both our lab group and fellow interns at Hood College. At the end of the summer internship, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel both sad and excited: sad because of my co-intern leaving, but extremely excited at the prospect of publishing a paper for a technical conference on our work, a possibility our mentor presented.</p>
                <p class="story-content">All in all, the summer experience wasn‚Äôt perfect: it sure had its highs and lows. With that being said, I can‚Äôt attribute much of the pitfalls to the organization of the internship program nor my mentor, but my flaws as a student. I‚Äôm grateful at how the WHKs have the summer to ‚Äútrain,‚Äù as I believe that I ended the summer on a good note but with more promise to trend further upwards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p class="story-content">As my senior year started, new variables came into play: I had a new co-intern, was pushing the full head of steam on the internship project from the summer, and had to balance numerous classes and leadership positions to top it all off. In essence, nothing was new, only this time I was more ready for the challenge due to the harsh realizations I came across in the first half of the summer.</p>
            <p class="story-content">With machine learning being a particularly time-consuming science -- after all, neural network models can take hours to train -- I had to make sure to optimize my time appropriately. With three hours every day in the office, I made sure to spend a bit of time doing a literature review and reading other papers; building, refining, and testing models; and making sense of new data as they came in. To avoid the stress of sitting at my desk for the entire period, I also made sure to take occasional walks. These 10-15 minutes of mini-exercise helped to refocus my brain when it was jumbled on a problem, got me the much needed fresh air from time to time, and allowed me to indulge in social media or music breaks. With time being so limited, my time had to be optimized in a way that was also not crippling; as a result, I often found myself more productive during these chunks compared to the summer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p class="story-content">One of the parts of the internship that I didn‚Äôt perceive to be particularly impactful initially was the intern assignments. When I first sat in the orientation meeting at Frederick High, I was turned off to the idea of spending days out of my precious time doing research on career objectives or interviewing my employers. However, these intern assignments were delights, delights that often let me escape from the sheer computational tasks of my internship.</p>
            <p class="story-content">For starters, given that I was in all AP classes at the time, I finally had the chance to engage in more project-based learning, allowing me to flex my muscles in things such as software development to help me show off the research I had done.</p>  
            <p class="story-content">Also, the projects gave me a chance to conduct some introspection during a hectic time where I had no time to stop thinking: for once, I could consider the pros and cons of my experience, ask myself what I wanted from the position, and consider the applications of the skills I had learned.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-5">
            <div id="animation8"><h2 id="story-title">A Wholesome Reflection ‚ù§Ô∏è </h2></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-7">
            <p class="story-content">I can‚Äôt reflect on too many of the fairly recent events because they all felt fairly transient: the start of academic team season, the submission of college applications, and the deadline for the conference we submitted our publication all were at about the same time. I had never worked so hard in my life: just ask my parents on the number of days I‚Äôd stay late at the office, the number of naps I‚Äôd take upon getting to my room, and the difficulty with which I would get up out of bed.</p>
            <p class="story-content">Nonetheless, the hard work paid off: by some stroke of luck, my co-intern and I won the Frederick County Science Fair, and our paper will be getting published in the Practice & Experience in Advanced Research Computing Conference (PEARC) proceedings in July. Of course, it can be easy to say that I had a lot of fun in retrospect, but the process of working on research was a truly enriching opportunity that I would never trade for the world.</p>
            <p class="story-content">When I look back at my internship, many of the skills that I learned were not at all related to computer science. Sure, I had to write a lot of code and delve deep into the theoretical field of machine learning. Nonetheless, I learned a lot of skills related to scientific communication. Writing the publication has been a quite arduous learning experience, to say the least: while I said it was different from a college and/or scholarship essay, it is also drastically different compared to a long essay question or literary comparison essay in other humanities classes. Throughout the process, I had to learn the importance of word choice, making sure to explicitly define scientific concepts, and even being concise while still conveying all of the details.</p>
            <p class="story-content">Also, the internship experience opened my eyes to the vast amount of career paths available to me. My interests have always been in computer science, but before the internship, I had my mind placed primarily on entrepreneurship: know the fundamentals of programming, start a startup, get rich in Silicon Valley, etc. However, I have now experienced first hand the beauty of doing research that has grandiose implications within the medical community. Thus, rather than pushing myself down the road of the typical Silicon Valley engineer, I am now compelled to also consider Research & Development, especially in terms of interdisciplinary research that could lead to the next medical breakthrough.</p>  
            <p class="story-content">All in all, the internship provided great balance during my senior year. Before, I was always fixated on school; during the past summer, I was engrossed in just my internship; now, it felt like I had the space to enjoy both the intellectual thrills of academia and the ability to think freely and make mistakes within my internship. The timing felt perfect.</p>
